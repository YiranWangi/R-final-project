Abstract

Housing price prediction remains a fundamental challenge in real estate analytics. This study investigates predictive modeling of housing prices through machine learning approaches in the era of big data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we identified key features influencing housing prices and evaluated three prediction algorithms: linear regression, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).

The analysis framework incorporated multiple regression techniques, CART optimization through pruning, and cross-validation for GBDT parameter tuning. Results demonstrate GBDT's superior performance in handling imbalanced datasets and nonlinear relationships. The model exhibits enhanced generalization capability and robustness compared to traditional approaches, while effectively addressing overfitting concerns.
